    <h2>My BLOG Page</h2>
    <h3>This Blog Page is my second project.</h3>

    <p>This project was created during weeks 2-3 of my coding boot camp.</p>
    <p>I used Visual Studio MVC with individual user authentication to generate this project.</p>
    <p>This project was also my first exposure to creating and using an SQL database.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Please read my Blog entries and contact me if you have any questions about what I am doing or anything that I have done.</p>
